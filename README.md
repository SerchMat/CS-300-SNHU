1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  Ensuring that our code, program, or software is functional I implemented various test strategies to ensure that the program worked as expected. Keeping the code simple, using easy names for the developer can understand the code, adopt a standard code, test frequently and eliminate vulnerabilities.
  
2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  First, if there is any question it needs to be clarified before starting working on the project. Dividing of the needs the customer into a small task is easier to understand and implement, also if there is a problem is easier to solve. Ask for a visualitzation of the final product also help to understand.
  
3) How do I approach designing software?

   First, understand the project, read through the requierements, and have a visualization of what is going on. Second, I divide the project into small tasks and tested will finishing each class and making sure that works perfectly before moving on to the next task. After finishing, test the whole project to make sure all work once is tested at the same time.
